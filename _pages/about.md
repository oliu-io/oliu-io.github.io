Iâ€™m a second-year Ph.D student in Computer Science at University of Southern California, fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Dani Yogatama](https://dyogatama.github.io/) and [Prof. Willie Neiswanger](https://willieneis.github.io/). In life, my friends call me Oliver ðŸ«’

I'm passionate about designing multimodal foundation models that accelerate scientific discovery. Towards this, my research foci include foundation model pre-training, understanding and exploring their capabilities, as well as continual training to align them with human desiderata. By focusing on these areas, I aim to develop trustworthy models that not only advance artificial intelligence but also serve practical purposes in various scientific domains.

Before USC, I was a researcher in continuous optimization with [Prof. Jorge Nocedal](https://jnocedal.github.io/) at Northwestern University. Even before that, I did my B.S+M.S at Carnegie Mellon University, majoring in [machine learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/academics/machine-learning-masters-curriculum.html).

At USC, I co-lead the [AI Safety Club](https://www.notion.so/aisafetyusc/About-Us-026a440a9c204050b0160121aab8a88a), a student-run organization that advocates for safety in advanced AI systems. We run semester-long curriculums in [introductory topics](https://aisafetyusc.notion.site/Intro-Track-da1b7bbf96db436ba365dbd41f8db686) and [technical areas](https://aisafetyusc.notion.site/Advanced-Track-b331dfaa45a44eae82852ed1b2dc9303).

I love spending time with my border collie pup [Doodle](https://www.instagram.com/doodleisnotadoodle/)! He lives with my family in the beautiful State of Washington.
