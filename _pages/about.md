ÂàòÂçìÁÑ∂ (Li√∫ Zhu√≥-R√°n) ‚Ä¢ he/him ‚Ä¢ me@[this-domain-url]

I‚Äôm a second-year Ph.D student in Computer Science at University of Southern California, fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Dani Yogatama](https://dyogatama.github.io/) and [Prof. Willie Neiswanger](https://willieneis.github.io/). In life, my friends call me Oliver ü´í

I am interested in multimodal foundation models (FM). My current research foci involve exploring and understanding their potential in facilitating scientific discovery. I am particularly excited about:
- Designing new architectures and algorithms that are broadly applicable to scientific modalities, such as (meta)genomics, protein, multiphysics, chemistry, and material sciences.
- Expanding methods in LLM post-training -- such as preference learning and representation learning -- to elicit controllable and interpretable behavior from multimodal scientific FMs.

Before USC, I was a researcher in continuous optimization with [Prof. Jorge Nocedal](https://jnocedal.github.io/) at Northwestern University. Even before that, I did my B.S+M.S at Carnegie Mellon University, majoring in [machine learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/academics/machine-learning-masters-curriculum.html).

At USC, I co-lead the [AI Safety Club](https://www.notion.so/aisafetyusc/About-Us-026a440a9c204050b0160121aab8a88a), a student-run organization that advocates for safety in advanced AI systems. We run semester-long curriculums in [introductory topics](https://aisafetyusc.notion.site/Intro-Track-da1b7bbf96db436ba365dbd41f8db686) and [technical areas](https://aisafetyusc.notion.site/Advanced-Track-b331dfaa45a44eae82852ed1b2dc9303).
