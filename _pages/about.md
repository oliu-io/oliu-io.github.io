Oliver IRL • 刘卓然 (Liú Zhuó-Rán) • he/him • me [at] [this-domain-url]

I’m a second-year Ph.D student in Computer Science at University of Southern California, fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Dani Yogatama](https://dyogatama.github.io/) and [Prof. Willie Neiswanger](https://willieneis.github.io/).

I'm interested in multimodal foundation models. These days, I'm exploring their potential as agents of complex reasoning and scientific discovery. I'm particularly excited about:
- Designing and understanding architectures and algorithms that are applicable to scientific modalities, such as (meta)genomics, protein, physics, chemistry, and material sciences.
- Developing post-training and inference-time methods that enable FMs to solve complex reasoning and decision making problems.

Before USC, I was a researcher in continuous optimization with [Prof. Jorge Nocedal](https://jnocedal.github.io/) at Northwestern University. Even before that, I did my B.S+M.S at Carnegie Mellon University, majoring in [machine learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/academics/machine-learning-masters-curriculum.html).

At USC, I co-lead the [AI Safety Club](https://www.notion.so/aisafetyusc/About-Us-026a440a9c204050b0160121aab8a88a), a student-run organization that advocates for safety in advanced AI systems. We run semester-long curriculums in [introductory topics](https://aisafetyusc.notion.site/Intro-Track-da1b7bbf96db436ba365dbd41f8db686) and [technical areas](https://aisafetyusc.notion.site/Advanced-Track-b331dfaa45a44eae82852ed1b2dc9303).
