Iâ€™m a second-year Ph.D student in Computer Science at University of Southern California, fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Dani Yogatama](https://dyogatama.github.io/) and [Prof. Willie Neiswanger](https://willieneis.github.io/). Here are my [CV](ollie-collie.github.io/assets/pdf/oliu_cv.pdf) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4rriqlQAAAAJ&hl=en) profile.

My current research interests lie in (multi-modal) foundation models, including reasoning, interpretability, decision making, and applications in sciences. I often seek insights from statistics and optimization.

Before USC, I was a researcher in continuous optimization with [Prof. Jorge Nocedal](https://jnocedal.github.io/) at Northwestern University. Even before that, I did my B.S+M.S at Carnegie Mellon University, majoring in [machine learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/academics/machine-learning-masters-curriculum.html).

I love spending time with my border collie pup [Doodle](https://www.instagram.com/doodleisnotadoodle/)! He lives with my family in the beautiful State of Washington.
